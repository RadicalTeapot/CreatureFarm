# Creature Farm

## Ideas:
- Player is the hive mind controlling creature
- When starting adventure, creature are created from pool of available genetic material
- While adventuring, creature assimilates enemies to store their genetic material
- If not killed, creature comes back and sacrifices itself to release all stored genetic material in the material pool
- If killed, material is lost (low chance of partial/total recovery by another creature sent to the same adventure)
- Enemy assimilation as well as environment adaptation leads to new genetic abilities when creature is turned back to genetic material
- Knowledge is only gathered when biomass is gathered (creature should return automatically when biomass container is full)
- Creature size (and cost) is determined by number of mutations applied, the bigger the creature the more expansive the mutations (have a global multiplier for applied mutation costs)
- Some applied mutation parts can be shared between mutations (e.g venomous bite shares venom glands with venomous claws)
- Have a mutation designer that can put together knowledges to form new mutations
- Like Ai Wars : Left alone by bad guys if not making too much trouble. More trouble means much bigger resistance and possible wipe if too much and too weak to fight back.
Have "fleet" manager like Stellaris for creature groups.
- All text, center panel describes action/creature/....


# TODO
- __Add tooltips for further info display__
- __Grey out non available mutations instead of hiding them and display why un-available in tooltip__
- Add alive status, held biomass amount to current adventure creature list entries
- Build enemies the same way creatures are built (specifying mutations and earing knowledge based on those when killed)
- Switch template/group/adventure ui code to use template/group/Adventure ids instead of names for internal data representation__ or __Make data indexing for mutations,... by name instead of internal id
- Change mutations to behave like siralim 3 traits
- Improve fight system
- Display available adventures/mutation first then rest greyed out based (availability is determined by creature skills and/or inventory contents)
- Refactor screens to more tightly follow the MVC pattern (split ui and logic in two separate classes)
- Add some mutation to increase biomass container size of creatures
