# Creature Farm

## Ideas:
- All text, center panel describes action/creature/....
- Player has no direct control over creature, can just give orders
- Creature must hunt for food
- Stay dead when killed during adventure
- Sleep to restore HP
- Can prepare meals for temp stat increase and healing to be used before or during adventures (e.g creature heals itself when reaching 0 hp while adventure)
- Earns XP, stat levels
- Can make mutagen to mutate and unlock new ablities
- During hunts, can capture new creatures to expand stable
- Choose which creature to send hunt
- Player has to manage stable
- Can mate creatures for mutated offsprings
- Higher level creatures, creatures get needs for special buildings/meals
- Let player hatch eggs and make it look like opening a loot box
- The game is turn based, each creature can do at most one action a day (adventure(last more than one day), research, cook, ...). If not adventuring, they rest for one point at the end of the day.


# TODO
- Change new adventure UI so right panel is empty till both creature and adventure are selected (display available adventures first then rest greyed out based (availability is determined by creature skills))
