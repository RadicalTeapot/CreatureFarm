# Creature Farm

## Ideas:
- All text, center panel describes action/creature/....
- Can use mouse on menus
- Player has no direct control over creature, can just give orders
- Creature must hunt for food
- When dead teleports back to home
- Sleep to restore HP
- Can prepare meals for temp stat increase
- Earns XP, stat levels
- Can make mutagen to mutate and unlock new ablities
- During hunts, can capture new creatures to expand stable
- Choose which creature to send hunt
- Player has to manage stable
- Can mate creatures for mutated offsprings
- After adventure or higher level creatues, creatures get needs for special buildings/meals
- Let player hatch eggs and make it look like opening a loot box
